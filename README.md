# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY

## Business Objective:
The company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating loans.Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. 
Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
Identification of such applicants whose loans have a higher risk of getting 'charged-off' and what factors drive to 'charge-off' is the aim of this case study. 
We have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the provided data and identify such potential drivers for 'charge-off'.The company will use this to take
decisions regarding which loan applications to approve or reject in future.
